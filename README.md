The goal is to be able to **browse, analyze, and compare** Trackmania replay data.
For that, we're aiming to provide a wide variety of tools such as a 3D view of the map and detailed charts with all the available data.

The live project can be found at [tmdojo.com](https://tmdojo.com).

While this project is actively being developed, we're all working on it in our free time - so updates will come when they're ready.

## Project Structure

The project has three parts:

- `/app`: React.js front-end
- `/server`: Node.js back-end for data storage and centralized calculations
- `/plugin`: [Openplanet](https://openplanet.nl) plugin to record players' racing data in-game

## Setup

Each of the three parts have to be set up individually - check out the respective README files.
